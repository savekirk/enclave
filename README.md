# DevCongress PROBLEM OF THE WEEK 3 - COUNTRIES WITHIN COUNTRIES
The relationship between Lesotho and South Africa (seen on any modern map of Africa) is interesting because Lesotho is entirely surrounded by South Africa. Vatican, if you consider it a sovereign state is also entirely surrounded by Italy. When the territory of a sovereign state A is wholly surrounded by territory of another sovereign state B, we say that B enclaves A. So, South Africa enclaves Lesotho, and the Vatican is enclaved by Italy.
To simplify things, let's assume that all territories are rectangles, such that their four corners can be represented by four points. Write a program, `is_enclaved_by(A, B)` which returns true if A is enclaved by B, false otherwise.
